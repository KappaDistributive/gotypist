Gotypist is a toy project that I'm creating to learn some GoLang fundamentals.

It's meant to become a simple typing tutor for the command line, similar to gtypist,
while addressing some of the annoyances of the latter.

In order to try gotypist, execute `make run` from this directory, select a lesson with the arrow keys and start typing.
