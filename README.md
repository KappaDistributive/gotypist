Gotypist is a toy project that I'm creating to learn some golang fundamentals.

It's meant to become a simple typing tutor for the command line, similar to gtypist,
while addressing some of the annoyances of the latter.

In order to try gotypist, execute `make run` from this directory, select a lesson with the arrow keys and start typing.

Alternatively, run `go get github.com/KappaDistributive/gotypist/v1` to install `gotypist` to your go path.
