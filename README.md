It offers two modes:

- `Prose mode` let's the user select a lesson from provided sample texts or add their own.
- `Dash mode` (e.g. Top 300 words) dynamically creates a random lesson of a certain size using words from a fixed list
  of options (e.g. the 300 most frequently used words in American English). 

Gotypist is best suited for people who already know how to (touch) type and intend to improve their accuracy and/or
typing speed.

In order to try gotypist, execute `make run` from this directory, select a lesson with the arrow keys and start typing.

Alternatively, run `go get github.com/KappaDistributive/gotypist/v1` to install `gotypist` to your go path.
