content: "Progress is not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 we were able to send people to the moon. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only take people to lower earth orbits. Then the Space Shuttle retired and the United States could take no one to orbit. So that's the trend. The trend is down to nothing. People are mistaken to think that technology does automatically improve. It does not automatically improve; it only improves when a lot of people work very hard to make it better. And actually, it will by itself degrade. You look at advanced civilizations like Egypt. They built the pyramids and forgot how to do that. And the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it. I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear: I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad."
